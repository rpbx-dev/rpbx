# Contributing to RPBX

Thanks for wanting to contribute to RPBX — we build in public and iterate fast. This file gives a short checklist and preferred workflow.

## Quick Checklist
- Read the BRAND_VOICE.md and follow tone & labeling guidelines.
- Search open issues before filing a new one.
- Label experimental work with `[PoC]` or `[experiment]` in the issue title or PR title.
- Keep changes small and focused; document rationale in the PR description.

## How to open an Issue
- Use the Issues tab and choose a clear title. Start the description with the purpose, steps to reproduce (if applicable), and suggested next steps.
- Tag the issue with relevant labels (e.g., `PoC`, `experiment`, `enhancement`, `bug`).

## Pull Request Process
1. Fork the repo and create a branch named `pr/{short-description}` or `experiment/{short-description}`.
2. Make small commits with clear messages. Use `[PoC]` or `[experiment]` in the message when appropriate.
3. Push and open a PR against `main` describing:
   - What changed
   - Why it changed (decision reasoning)
   - Any trade-offs or open questions
   - How to test
4. Add reviewers and request feedback.

## Coding Standards
- Keep code and examples minimal and documented.
- Include tests or reproducible steps where practical.
- Use simple, accessible language in docs and commit messages.

## Communication
- Use issues for design decisions and experiments.
- If something is sensitive or needs private discussion, contact the maintainers directly (open an issue and mark it `private-request` or email the project owner).

Thanks — every contribution teaches us something.
